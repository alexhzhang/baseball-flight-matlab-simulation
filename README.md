# Baseball Flight Simulation with Aerodynamic Drag (MATLAB)

This project implements a full numerical simulation of a baseball’s 2D flight path under aerodynamic drag using MATLAB. It models coupled horizontal and vertical motion, incorporates a nonlinear drag force proportional to velocity squared, and compares the numeric trajectory against the analytic no-drag solution. The work demonstrates physical modeling, numerical integration, validation against analytic benchmarks, and data export for downstream analysis.

# 🧠 **Physics & Modeling**

This project models a baseball as a point mass acted on by two forces:

### • Gravity
The constant downward force:
  
`F_g = -m g`

### • Aerodynamic Drag
A velocity-dependent force opposing the direction of motion:

`F_d = -(1/2) * C * ρ * A * v^2`

* **C** — drag coefficient (user input)
* **ρ** — air density
* **A** — cross-sectional area of the baseball
* **v** — instantaneous speed (magnitude of velocity vector)

The drag force is decomposed into x- and y-components based on the current velocity direction.

## 🔢 **Numerical Method**

The solver updates position and velocity at each time step:

```
vx = vx + ax*dt
vy = vy + ay*dt

x(k+1) = x(k) + vx*dt + 0.5*ax*dt^2
y(k+1) = y(k) + vy*dt + 0.5*ay*dt^2
```

Time is discretized using `linspace` with ~1000 intervals for smooth trajectories.

## 🧪 **Validation**

When the user enters:

```
C = 0
```

drag is disabled.
The script automatically checks:

* Numeric x(t) ≈ Analytic x(t)
* Numeric y(t) ≈ Analytic y(t)

via absolute error sums, confirming integrator correctness under no-drag conditions.

## 📈 **Visualization**

The script plots:

* The **numeric drag trajectory** (ft vs ft)
* Fully labeled axes
* Title with chosen drag coefficient
* Gridlines and improved readability

This allows visual analysis of drag effects on range and height.

## 📤 **Data Export**

A full trajectory matrix is exported to Excel:

```
M = [t, x(m), y(m), x(ft), y(ft)]
writematrix(M, 'phase3_export.xlsx')
```

This enables further analysis in MATLAB, Excel, or Python.
